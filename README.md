# Coaching by Oscar
 

Coaching by Oscar is a site dedicated to PT-clients of mine, both new and old. It's designed to inspire them with sessions they've already done or maybe some they haven't yet got around to trying. 
The site contains both a page for the actual session and a page with instructions.
