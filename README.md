New project created to make a site about training.

On this project i've tried to use the display: flex; function to make the different divs work properly.
Collected all photos from stock sites like, stocksnap.io, rawpixel.com and pixabay.com, except for one of them that's a picture of me.
Got some useful tips and tricks from w3schools.com

Index page
1. Tried the flex function on the nav and it worked great.
2. After the nav function I aligned the content on main page and created a footer.
3. Used Font Awesome to get the some icons for social media to the footer, also used a little help from an old code we used in an earlier project to help get the footer right.
4. Inserted a hero-image and fixed the outer borders for it. It now shows up nicely on both a smaller and larger screen. As of writing I have not tried it out on my own phone yet.

Exercise page
1. Copied the index page to make afoundation for the exercise page.
2. Went through some of the sites mentioned at the top for some inspiration to the various pages hero-images.
3. Got a couple of GIFs symbolizing the exercise movements
4. Put in a couple of divs with the flex function to make the page work nicely on the different screens.

Session Page
1. Created a session page containing tables for and layput of a session with the exercises.
2. Mixtured quite awhile with the layout and settle for a center-oriented view.
3. Switched out the background-color for the tables to get a more aesthetic color.
4. Came back again after the About page was done to change and add the last table fixes in css.

About page
1. The last page is a description about me and who i am.
2. I used a copy of the index.html to create the background.
3. Added a longer description about my background and made it function properly on all screen sizes.

Deployment
1. Having some trouble getting the published version on github to look like the preview one on Gitpod.
Can't really seem to get why the versions are differing.
