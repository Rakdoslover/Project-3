New project created to make a site about training.

On this project i've tried to use the display: flex; function to make the different divs work properly.

Tried the flex function on the nav and it worked great.
After the nav function I aligned the content on main page and created a footer.
Used Font Awesome to get the som icons for social media to the footer, also used a little help from an old code we used in an earlier project to help get the footer right.
