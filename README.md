New project created to make a site about training.

On this project i've tried to use the display: flex; function to make the different divs work properly.
Collected all photos from stock sites like, stocksnap.io, rawpixel.com and pixabay.com, except for one of them that's a picture of me.
Got some useful tips and tricks from w3schools.com

Tried the flex function on the nav and it worked great.
After the nav function I aligned the content on main page and created a footer.
Used Font Awesome to get the som icons for social media to the footer, also used a little help from an old code we used in an earlier project to help get the footer right.

Inserted a hero-image and fixed the outer borders for it. It now shows up nicely on both a smaller and larger screen. As of writing I have not tried it out on my own phone yet.

Created a session page containing tables for and layput of a session with the exercises.
Mixtured quite awhile with the layout and settle for a center-oriented view.
Switched out the background-color for the tables to get a more aesthetic color.

The last page is a description about me and who i am.
I used a copy of the index.html to create the background.
