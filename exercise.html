            Start off by standing shoulder width apart with your shins just barely gracing the bar.
            Lean forward with straight arms until you can grab the bar with an overhand grip.
            Lower your hips as low as you can while still having straight shins or until your upper body is angled vertically or just slightly upwards.
            Push off the ground by pushing forward through the hip, end the motion when standing up.

            With the bar positioned firmly and safely on your neck muscle, put your feet shoulder width apart pointing forwards.
            Your hands should be positioned as tight as possible, when your shoulder blades are being squeezed you should be good to go.
            Push your hips backwards while bending your knees in a controlled movement downward.
            Try to go as deep as possible before turning the movement, never stop fully at the bottom.
            Finish the movement standing while clenching your gluteus muscle.

            This exercise can be performed either with your feet on a step-board, a box or on the floor. We’ll be using the step-board for these instructions.
            Place the board against a wall or somewhere stable, place your feet on the edge of the board a decimeter from each other.
            Usually we use a barbell or a dumbbell as a weight but if you're not used to balancing at the edge of the board then start off with just your own body-weight.
            Lower your heels towards the ground in a controlled motion. try to stretch your calf muscle as far as possible.
            When at the bottom, shoot upward until you’re almost at the tip of your toes.

            Place yourself sitting just in front of the box/bench, place your feet shoulder width apart just in front of you and push yourself up on the box so that your shoulder blades are firmly on the box/bench.
            Place the bar, preferably equipped with a neck pillow, right over your hip bones.
            From the sitting position, push your hips upward while simultaneously leaning backwards onto the box/bench.
            At the very top your body should form the “L-shape”, clench your glutes.
            Slowly return to the sitting position and repeat.
