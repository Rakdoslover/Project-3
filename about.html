            My name is Oscar Lundsor and for about 8 years now i've been coaching everything between beginners to professional athletes.
            This page is supposed to be a platform for me to deploy a tip or two about exercises and workouts.

            Got a bachelor's degree in Coaching and Sport Management at Linnaeus University in Växjö Sweden.
            This is where my love for sports and coaching really took off.
            Ever since I've been actively coaching athletes, and my main focus has been youth development.
            The gratitude you get from seeing a young player develop from into a semiprofessional, or even fullfletched professional is something else.

            A couple of years back I was hired as a PT and started working with clients on a daily basis.
            Having only one person to focus on at a time was a new experience, but it's very rewarding and you really get to know the client on a whole new level.
            The sessions featured on this site are some of the once I've already tried with clients.
